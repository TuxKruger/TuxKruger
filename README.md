## Pratyush Sharma

I am a 16 year old Science Student (PCM) who loves the world of FOSS. I am trying to learn more and more about Linux, Coding, Hacking and other stuff that I find interesting.

### What am I learning nowadays?

Rust (for fun), Python (for automation and school), C (no idea why, it just looked shiny), Web Development (for my own site, mainly frontend) and Shell scripting (for making my life easier, python's better though :p)
